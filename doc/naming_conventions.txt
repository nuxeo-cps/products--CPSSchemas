Rationale
=========

It is important that the all the vocabularies, schemas and layouts follow the
same naming conventions so that CPS and projects based on it have consistent
code. That makes code more easily understandable.

In a CPS portal the vocabularies, schemas and layouts can respectively be found
in the portal_vocabularies, portal_schemas and portal_layouts tools.


Naming conventions
==================

Vocabularies
------------

Vocabulary names should all be lowercase letters with the separator "_" between
words.

Vocabulary names should not end with any suffix. For example don't put "_voc" or
"_vocabulary" at the end of your vocabulary names. The fact that they are
vocabularies is enough to distinguish them since we all retrieve them from
the portal_vocabularies tool.

At the time of this writing, the vocabulary names in portal_vocabularies are
not yet consistent between each other and with the naming conventions. This will
eventually be fixed cf. #700.

Schemas
-------

Schema names should all be lowercase letters with the separator "_" between
words.

Schema names should not end with any suffix. For example don't put "_sch" or
"_schema" at the end of your schema names.  The fact that they are schemas is
enough to distinguish them since we all retrieve them from the portal_schemas
tool.

Layouts
-------

Layout names should all be lowercase letters with the separator "_" between
words.

Layout names should not end with any suffix. For example don't put "_lay" or
"_layout" at the end of your schema names. The fact that they are layout is
enough to distinguish them since we all retrieve them from the portal_layouts
tool.
