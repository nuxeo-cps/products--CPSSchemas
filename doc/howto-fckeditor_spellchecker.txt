Introduction
============

.. _CPS: http://www.fckeditor.net/
.. _FCKeditor: http://www.fckeditor.net/

The aim of this short documentation is to explain how to use a server-side
spellchecker such as `aspell` in the FCKeditor_ WYSIWYG HTML editor in a
CPS_ context.

The FCKeditor WYSIWYG HTML editor is used for the CPS text widgets when they are
in HTML mode.



Setup
=====


Installing the server-side spellchecker utility
-----------------------------------------------

First of all you need to have the `aspell` program and needed dictionary
installed on the host system::

  $ apt-get install aspell aspell-en

Of course you could install other dictionaries than the English
dictionary. Possible choices are ``aspell-fr``, ``aspell-es``, etc.

Then you have to install a file from the FCKeditor Zope product on the
web server that will be used to perform the spell checking,
that is, on the host system, copying
``FCKeditor/skins/fckeditor/editor/dialog/fck_spellerpages/spellerpages/server-scripts/spellchecker.php``
as
``/var/www/speller/server-scripts/spellchecker.php``
.

And then you need to modify the `spellchecker.php` script so that it corresponds
to your environment. Since CPS web pages are served as ``ISO-8859-15`` be sure
to specify an ``ISO-8859-15`` locale as the `lang` parameter, otherwise you
would receive weird characters (due to encoding problems).

Here is an example for using an English dictionary::

  $aspell_prog = 'aspell';
  $lang = 'en_US@euro';

Here is an example for using a French dictionary::

  $aspell_prog = 'aspell';
  $lang = 'fr_FR@euro';


Enable server-side spellchecking on the client
----------------------------------------------

Then you need to enable the spell checking on the user interface and tell it to
use the server-side implementation.

To do so you need to customize the FCKeditor configuration file which is::

  CPSSchemas/skins/cps_schemas/fckconfig-cps.js

The configuration should be::

  // Specifying the "SpellerPages" spellchecker server-side implementation
  FCKConfig.SpellChecker = 'SpellerPages';

  // Adding the "SpellCheck" button on the toolbar that you are currently using.
  // "Semantic" is the default toolbar used by CPSSchemas.
  FCKConfig.ToolbarSets['Semantic'] = [
      ['Italic','Bold','FontFormat'],
      ['-','OrderedList','UnorderedList','-','Link','Unlink','-','SpellCheck'],
      ['Image','Table','Rule'],
      '/',
      ['RemoveFormat','Undo','Redo','Source']
  ];


Configuring which spellchecking service to use
----------------------------------------------

Finally you need to configure which spellchecking service should be used by the
client.

The actual code of FCKeditor makes it only possible  to configure which
server-side spellchecker you can/want to use through Apache configuration.

Apache
......

You can perform the needed configuration through Apache configuration
directives.

Apache2 virtualhost configuration::

  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^(.*)/editor/dialog/fck_spellerpages/spellerpages/server-scripts/spellchecker.php
  RewriteRule ^/(.*) /var/www/speller/server-scripts/spellchecker.php [L]

  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization}  ^(.*)
  RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://localhost:8080/VirtualHostBase/http/%{HTTP_HOST}:80/cps/VirtualHostRoot/$1 [P,L]


Customizing through skins
.........................

It would be useful if we could perform the needed configuration through
customizing the ``spellChecker.js`` FCKeditor file.
Unfortunately it doesn't work.

In
``FCKeditor/skins/fckeditor/editor/dialog/fck_spellerpages/spellerpages/spellChecker.js``
we would like to just have to modify the following line::

  // Original line:
  //this.spellCheckScript = 'server-scripts/spellchecker.php';
  // New configuration example:
  this.spellCheckScript = 'http://spellmachine/speller/server-scripts/spellchecker.php';

Unfortunately it doesn't work.
