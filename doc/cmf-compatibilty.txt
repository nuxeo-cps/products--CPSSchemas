CMF compatibility :
--------------------

CPSSchemas works just fine within a 'stock' CMF instance.
CPSSchemas is a framework. If you're looking for 'out of the box' content
types install CPSDocument on your CMF. (same dependencies as below)

DEPENDENCIES :
---------------

Here stand below the mandatory products for CPSSchemas within the CMF:

 - CPSInstaller (Used for the installation only)
   You can launch the intaller through the CMFQuickInstaller though.

 - Epoz 7.4

 - TranslationService >= 0.5.0

 - Localizer = 1.0.1

 - PortalTransforms -> CVS Nuxeo : http://cvs.nuxeo.com (didn't the test the
   logilab version for while can't say anything)

Localizer and TranslationService stands still here because of the skins.  It
can be successfully installed without though but the widgets are going to be
broken.

TESTS on a 'stock' CMF :
-------------------------

You can launch tests against CPSSchemas within the tests
sub-directory. You'll need for that Localizer and TranslationService

Simply go to the test directories and type :

 $ make test
