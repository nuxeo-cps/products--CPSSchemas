CMF compatibility
=================

CPSSchemas works just fine within a 'stock' CMF instance.
CPSSchemas is a framework. If you're looking for 'out of the box'
content types install CPSDocument on your CMF. (same dependencies
as below)

Actually tested with CMF-1.4.7


Dependencies
============

Here are the mandatory products for CPSSchemas within the
CMF:

- CPSInstaller (Used for the installation only)

  You can launch the installer through the CMFQuickInstaller though.

- Epoz 7.4

- TranslationService >= 0.5.0

- Localizer = 1.0.1

- PortalTransforms -> CVS Nuxeo : http://svn.nuxeo.com (didn't
  test the logilab version, so can't say anything)

Localizer and TranslationService stands still here because of the
skins.  It can be successfully installed without though but the
widgets are going to be broken.


TESTS on a 'stock' CMF
======================

You can launch tests against CPSSchemas within the tests
sub-directory. You'll need for that Localizer and
TranslationService

Simply go to the test directories and type::

    $ make test


.. Emacs
.. Local Variables:
.. mode: rst
.. End:
.. Vim
.. vim: set filetype=rst:
