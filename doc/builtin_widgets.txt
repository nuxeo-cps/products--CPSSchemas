Image Widget
============

The Image Widget and its derivatives behave like a compound widget:
the display size can be exposed in edit mode to the user through an
auxiliary widget, whose id is specified in the ``widget_ids``
property.

If no such aux widget is specified, or if the corresponding field
value is empty or zero, then the ``size_spec`` property is used.

That way, depending on needs the configuration can leave a full liberty
to the user, or constrain (and help him) by a vocabulary (Select
Widget) or leave no liberty at all.
