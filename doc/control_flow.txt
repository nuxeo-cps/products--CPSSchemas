This document describes the "flow" in the NuxCPS3Document for the
complicated cases, namely data retrieval, document rendering and data
editing. It will describe it step by step as it happens, in the order of
1. Retreieving the data
2. Displaying a form with the data
3. Saving the updated data

To make it all somewhat clearler (or maybe not) there is the associated
control_flow.dia document that oulines what's in here graphically, but
in much less detail.

0. Introduction

  Each document will have an associated portal_type, defined in the
  portal_types tool. The type defined will probably be defined by a new type
  of portal type (instead of like Factory Type Information). The type
  definition is throughout this document referred to as a template.

1. Retreiving the data

  The documents data are accessed through a DataModel object. This
  object is created by calling the documents makeDataModel() method
  (This is actually currently done by the Template, but when document-
  specific schemas is implemented it will move to the Document).
  This method creates a DataModel object by fetching all the schemas that
  are valid for the document and adding them to the DataModel. The schemas
  can be either local to the document, local to the template, or some sort
  of global schemas (the exact way of setting up the global schemas have yet
  to be determined).

  A schema is a collection of fields, and the DataModel is basically a
  temporary collection of schemas, specific for each document. Each schema
  also has it's own storage settings, that determine where the data for the
  fields are to be stored. This could be an SQL database, or object
  properties, or something else. The data is accessed through StorageAdapters
  who are created by StorageAdapterFactories. Each schema has it's own
  StorageAdapterFactory with it's own settings.

  One StorageAdapter is created for each schema and kept in the DataModel
  for access to the data. Each StorageAdapter is also called upon to
  fetch the data. The data is also stored in the DataModel as a data 'cache'
  so that external storages isn't called upon each time you make a change.

  The makeDataModel() method then returns the new DataModel object.

  Data access

    You can access the data in the DataModel in two ways. Firstly the
    DataModel has a dictionary type interface, so to get the data for a field
    you just access the DataModel with datamodel['fieldname'] and the data
    will be returned. You can also create DataStructures. A DataStructure
    is a dictionary-type object that is especially designed for usage with
    forms. It keeps the data rendered into a format that is directly
    displayable, i.e. a text string (or possibly a number). This is used
    when rendering documents.

    (And it just struck me that if we are to have different format of one
    field in different Layouts, we need to call the FieldWidget to render,
    which means another refactoring...)

2. Displaying a form with the data

  Displaying a document is done by calling the documents render() method,
  with a parameter naming the Layout to be used when rendering. Layouts
  are collections of FieldWidget, each FieldWidget has a corresponding Field
  that the widget is responsable for rendering.

  The document fetches the Layout in question, either locally, if allowed or
  from the template, which in turn get's it locally or from the global
  storage.  The document then creates a DataModel (see above) and call the
  DataModels makeDataStructure method to create a DataStructure that is then
  passed to the Layouts render() method.

  The Layout will then in turn go through each FieldWidget, pick out the
  relevant data from the DataStructure and call each FieldWidgets render()
  method with that data, and with the layouts Renderer.

  A Renderer is an object that knows how to render basic graphical elements,
  such as bits of text, and editboxes. The FieldWidget in turn knows which
  of these graphical elements it needs to render the field. A text field
  will either be rendered as a string or as an editbox, and the FieldWidget
  know which, while the renderer in turn knows how to create strings and
  editboxes. It's important to note here that different layouts may render
  the same field differently. For exmaple most documents will have both
  view and edit layouts, one for viewing the document and one for editing
  it, where the view layout will render almost everything as text, while the
  edit layout will render everything as HTML fields.

  Each Layout will have it's own renderer, depending on which
  target the layout is created for. There may be a CmfRenderer that uses
  METAL macros defined in portal_skins to render, and a HtmlRenderer to
  render into pure HTML, and a PDF renderer to render to PDF-files, and
  TextRenderer to render into pure text (useful if you want to send document
  as e-mail, for example) and a StructuredText renderer to make the whole
  document into a STX file, etc...

  So the Layout calls render() on each FieldWidget who in turn calls the
  methods it needs on the Renderer, such as text() and editbox(). The
  Renderer returns a text-string that represents the rendering, which is
  concatenated together, and Layout.render() finally returns the full
  rendrition for display.

3. Saving the update data

  The procedure outlined under 2  is exactly the same no matter if it is a
  form or just an HTML page, or for that matter a PDF file. Asuuming that it
  is a form used for updating the documents data, this is the procedure to
  update the data from this form.

  When a document is updated, a DataStructure needs to be updated from
  the REQUEST object. The DataStructure could be created at this point,
  but to improve performance it may be beneficial to store the
  DataStructure as well as the DataModel created when the document form
  was rendered in a volatile attribute on the document.

  The DataStructure will go through it's fields to see if they exist in the
  REQUEST and update it's data accordingly. It also keeps track of which
  fields have been changed. After the update, the document passes the
  updated DataStructure to the DataModels commitDataStructure method.

  CommitDataStructure first validates the data in the DataStructure by
  calling the fields and validating the data with them. If all Fields
  validate properly, it updates it's internal storage of data. It uses
  the DataStructures modified flags to keep track of which schemas that have
  been affected by modified data. It then calls it's own _commitData method
  to commit the data for storage for each affected schema. It does this by
  using the writeData() method on the StorageAdapter connected to that
  Schema.

Thats it, I think. Hope this helps.
