_Description: When do you like to restart Zope?
 Zope has an extensible, object oriented structure that allows you to
 easily add extra components (products) or features. Each product or
 feature can usually be found in packages whose name starts with `zope-'
 prefix. Unfortunately, Zope needs to restart to use any new add-on. Here
 you can choose a common way to restart Zope:
  * configuring: each product will restart Zope while configuring.
  * end: Zope will restart only once at the end of the whole
         installation/upgrading process.
  * manually: You will have to restart Zope.
