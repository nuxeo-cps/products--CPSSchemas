#
#    Translators, if you are not familiar with the PO format, gettext
#    documentation is worth reading, especially sections dedicated to
#    this format, e.g. by running:
#         info -n '(gettext)PO Files'
#         info -n '(gettext)Header Entry'
#
#    Some information specific to po-debconf are available at
#            /usr/share/doc/po-debconf/README-trans
#         or http://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-debconf/README-trans
#
#    Developers do not need to manually edit POT or PO files.

"Zope has an extensible, object oriented structure that allows you to easily "
"add extra components (products) or features. Each product or feature can "
"usually be found in packages whose name starts with `zope-' prefix. "
"Unfortunately, Zope needs to restart to use any new add-on. Here you can "
"choose a common way to restart Zope:\n"
" * configuring: each product will restart Zope while configuring.\n"
" * end: Zope will restart only once at the end of the whole\n"
"        installation/upgrading process.\n"
" * manually: You will have to restart Zope."
