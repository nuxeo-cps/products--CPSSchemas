- Generic Select and Generic MultiSelect widgets have a new property
  'blank_value_ok_if_required' to specify whether a blank value in the
  given vocabulary should be considered ok when validating if the field is
  required.
  It gives the opportunity add blank values to the vocabulary just to
  change the way the list is presented (using items like 'choose a category' or
  '------------' to separate items) and not affect the way the value will be
  validated if the widget is required. Before this, if the widget was required,
  default behavior was to accept blank values if they were in the vocabulary
  (e.g blank_value_ok_if_required = 1)
