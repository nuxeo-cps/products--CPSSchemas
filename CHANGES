Requires:

New features:

Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Initializing img_info dict with 'height' and 'width' for Image and Photo
  widgets. The lack of initialization was problematic in some cases.
- Fixed problem of default values markers appearing in field expressions.
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Refactoring of unit tests.
- Adding the clear method to CPSVocabulary, as it was in the base Vocabulary.
- Added datamodel to the namespace of default value expressions in fields. This
  is safe because the argument defaults to None. Only documents provide their
  DataModel, it is too complicated for directories and lack use cases.
