New features:

Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- #1677: dependent fields didn't work for File Fields created by flexible
widgets (no preview, no indexing).
- Using LayoutTools renderLayout call with a context that has a 
  postCommitHook caused the hook to be called if the layout changed, which 
  on CPSDocuments would set the size to something wrong, and cause a commit
  transaction.
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- All fields get a new method _getAllDependantFieldIds
