Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
- Code calling getDefaultData() on the adapter should now also call a new
  method afterward
  data = adapter.getDefaultData()
  adapter.finalizeDefaults(data)
 
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Optimization: added a dirty_fields_map attribute to the DataModel to keep
  track of which field should be committed to the storage adapter. At the moment
  this optimization has the effect of computing dependent fields only when
  necessary and thus avoid unneeded plain text generation (for indexation) and
  html preview.

Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Optimized the validate() method of the CPSAttachedFileWidget
- Removing a widget without redoing the layout now doesn't raise an 
  error when you render a document. 
- You no longer can have a widget twice in a layouts layout.
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add a field class to manage all list field
