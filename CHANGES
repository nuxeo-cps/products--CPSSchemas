New features:

- Add a script to make available vocabulary keys sorted by label or by 
  translated msgid
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Generic select widget did not refuse validation of empty values when required
  if vocabulary did not hold blank values
- Made that in edit mode if a css class is specified, this is the class name
  suffixed by "_edit" that is returned. This is because in edit mode one usually
  doesn't want the widgets to have the same appearance that they have in view
  mode. Actually in edit mode one prefers to have all the widgets with the same
  neutral presentation.
- Removed some needless <span> elements used for i18n.
