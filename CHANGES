  DateTimeWidget cf. http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime
- File and attached file widgets now display a link to edit file online
  if external editor is installed.
- It is now possible to resize images already loaded in an Image widget.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Now img tags always have an "alt" attribute as required by the W3C specs, even
  if it is empty.
- Some XHTML cleaning.
- A file rejected by widget validation was presented as an accepted
  file to keep (file, attached file, image and photo widgets)
- A file or an image accepted by validation was lost when layout was not
  validated entirely
- Image and File widget validation did not take care of the fact that the widget
  could be required
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- File, Image, AttachedFile and Photo widgets have been refactored a little
  bit: all generic features have been put in File widget, and specific features
  are in each widget.
