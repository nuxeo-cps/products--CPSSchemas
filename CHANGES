ZODB Requires:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-

New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fields now have a read_process_dependent_fields property to specify which
  fields the depend on.
- New compound widget textimage

Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- old CPSDocument using deprecated CPSLinkWidget (not the compound) can be
  viewed
- CPSImageWidget, CPSPhotoWidget, CPSFileWidget and CPSAttachedFileWidget all
  assumed that the data was stored as a ZODB attribute. Now they instead ask
  the StorageAdapter for the URL to the content.
- Fixed typos in RTE widget meta_types:
  "CPS Rich Text EditorWidget" -> "CPS Rich Text Editor Widget"
  "CPS Rich Text Editor Widget Type " -> "CPS Rich Text Editor Widget Type"

New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added the possibility to restrict the fields managed by a storage adapter.
- improve link, photo css integration
- Renamed makeWidget to makeWidgetTypeInstance in WidgetTypeRegistry
