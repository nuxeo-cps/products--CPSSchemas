- Set a more efficient configuration for tidy:
  -indent, -wrap 80, --hide-comments no
- #1890: Image without image breaks Image Gallery.
  Part of the fix includes setting 'is_required' to True by default for
  'preview' field in image layout (done in CPSDefault package).
  Another part of fix is to correctly handle 'is_required' field when no
  image was supplied to 'Image Widget'.
